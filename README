This is a sample application for Appcelerator Alloy.

I went pretty FAR out on the edge and and implemented an Appcelerator Cloud Services (ACS) Adapter for Alloy.
This is based on some previous work I have done with ACS and Backbone integration.

Pretty certain there is room for refactoring; but just wanted to get started with the conversation and the effort
