Welcome to Alloy. Prepare to be amazed.
========================================

Titanium Alloys are metals which contain a mixture of Titanium and other chemical elements. Such Alloys have very high tensile strength and toughness (even at extreme temperatures). They are light weight, have extraordinary corrosion resistance and the ability to withstand extreme temperatures [1].  

We think Alloy for Titanium provides you, the developer, with the ability to run fast, jump high and general code like an amazing superstar.

Now to the serious stuff.
-------------------------

Here's how your Alloy directory is laid out.

models              your model files go here
controllers         your controllers files go here
views               yep, the views go here. you're getting it.
assets              place your images, sound files, etc here. They will be deployed into Resources.
migrations          your migrations go here. generate these. don't do these by hand.
styles              your stylesheets for your views go here.
config              this is configuration files, just like it says.
lib                 put your own libraries here and use require('name') to load it
vendor              place any third-party libraries you use and reference require('vendor/<name>')

Also, in the root is the alloy.jmk file.  This serves like a makefile and can be used to hook into the Alloy compiler to customize the build process.
